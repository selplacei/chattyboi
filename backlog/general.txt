- Use configuration wherever reasonable
- Don't use JSON in JSON for extension data. Why was that ever a good idea?
- Improve extension loading: refactor load_order signature, detect problems like missing dependencies earlier, user-friendly error output
- Extension tab that shows metadata and relationships
- Update mechanism for extensions
- A proper dedicated launcher (profile editing, adding, creation, importing, changing global settings that can't be edited at runtime)
- Async wrapper for the database
