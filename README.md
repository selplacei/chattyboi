# ChattyBoi

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/chattyboi/badge/?version=latest)](https://chattyboi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

**ChattyBoi** - chat bot framework, UI, and application that can support any chat platform.

By itself, ChattyBoi is more of a framework than a useful application. The "core", i.e. the base program, allows you to easily add _extensions_, which in turn can add platform integration, commands, new GUI elements, and much more.

The core defines things like a user, a chat, a message, etc., and provides easy ways for extensions to store data in a database, keep track of configs, and interact with each other. Additionally, the ChattyBoi launcher lets you store different profiles (instances of data and preferences), and the main application wraps everything together into a graphical interface.

In order to be useful as a chat bot, this application needs configuration. Some guides and presets (useful pre-configured profiles) will be available when the base program is done.

## Notable features:

- Completely free and open-source.
- Fully decentralized and hackable.
- Based on asyncio and Qt.
- Platform-independent.
- There doesn't have to be a "default chat", the users of which have to link their accounts to other chat platforms in order to use them.
- There is a huge potential for the extension ecosystem, since extensions are essentially arbitrary code - they can be used for any purpose.

Additionally, there already are **[WIP]** some nice extensions:

- Commands: the concepts of an "action" and a "trigger" are separated, and neither are tied to some limited set of functionality. In other words, commands can do anything; and, if needed, they can be executed in a variety of ways.
- Moderation: user roles, tags, blacklisting, configurable defaults, integration with commands and statistics.
- ChattyBoi Script: a custom scripting syntax to make commands more flexible and easy to write.
- Web dashboard: other extensions can use this to interact with chatters and moderators in a much cleaner and easier way than just commands.
- Full Twitch and Discord integration.

### **Why do we need another bot?**
One of the main selling points for ChattyBoi is that it's platform-independent. Extensions give you the ability to abstract away platform-specific interactions, and instead write and run things that work everywhere. For example, a command might only need to know that some specific text was sent to a chat and tell ChattyBoi to reply with some other text. The implementations of actually receiving and sending messages through that chat are left up to another extension.

This means that that extensions don't have to be re-written just to support Twitch, Discord, IRC, etc., unless they use APIs specific to those platforms.

## Installation
You can test what is done so far by cloning the repository and launching the installer or manually copying the files.
For now, the installer only works on Unix-like systems (macOS, Linux, etc.) since it's just a shell script.

Requirements: Python 3.8+

If your Python command is something other than `python`, edit `install.sh` at line 35.
```
git clone https://github.com/selplacei/chattyboi.git && cd chattyboi/scripts
sh install.sh --help
```

### **Motivation**
A certain Twitch streamer was the main inspiration behind this project. Come over to [ZeeGee_](https://twitch.tv/zeegee_) if you like variety streamers that have a nice smaller community!

## TODOs

- Improve the GUI: database viewer; config editor; extension list/info; better launcher, with creating profiles and configuring them before initialization; easier interaction with the GUI for extensions
- Generate docs for the code and write docs for extension developing
- Importing/exporting profiles and extensions
- Polish the UX and add any missing features
- Write extensions:
  * ChattyBoiScript
  * Moderation
  * Advanced Commands
  * Twitch integration
  * Anything else to make this at least as good as DeepBot
  * Discord integration
  * Web dashboard to be used by chatters, which will be supported by some of these other extensions
  * Statistics
- When a somewhat stable release is made, add ChattyBoi to the AUR
- Make a Windows installer
- (Possibly) CLI mode, either as a parameter or a separate executable.
